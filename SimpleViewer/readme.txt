What Simple Viewer Is

Simple Viewer is a slim image viewer that focuses on high quality image display a and 
minimalist interface. It does not include unnecessary features for things that you 
will use Photoshop for anyway. Instead it serves as an application to have a quick 
look at an image without having to launch a heavier application. It can also be used 
for presentation purposes and to evaluate how an image looks when it is downscaled to 
the actual screen resolution.

You can use the WinInstaller.exe to install Simple Viewer on your Windows system.

Simple Viewer  is open source. The code repsitory can be found at:
